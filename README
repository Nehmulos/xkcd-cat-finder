xkcd cat finder
===============
A tiny javascript page that searches xkcd for words referring to cats.
It uses xkcds json api to get data via jquery getJSON httpRequests.

It will browse through all xkcd comics from 1 to the latest and search
for the words "cat", "cats", "kitten" and "kittens".

It's a small piece of code that I just hacked for fun in < 1h.

===============
usage
===============
start chrome from comandline using

chromium-browser --disable-web-security

or

google-chrome --disable-web-security

This is necessary to allow chrome to get json files from 3rd party origins.
I'm looking for a workaround.
I didn't test it in other browsers, yet.


===============
TODO
===============
New versions might work in other browsers than chrome.
A new version could draw a canvas graph,
displaying the usage of cats in a timeline.
